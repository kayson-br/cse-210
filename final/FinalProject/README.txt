                                                            DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:

Project Type: Open-ended project

This open ended project will be a homework-scheduling app. Students often lose track of or forget all of their work that needs to get done. 
This program will allow students to record everything they need to do for their classes. The purpose of this project is to help students 
remember what they need to do so they can perform well in their classes.

The student will be presented with a menu where they can add classes as well as add information regarding work that is to be done in those 
classes. For example, I will be able to add CSE 210 along with the information about the assignments I need to do this week, their due 
dates, and how many points they're worth. This information will then be saved. The menu may also contain other functionality such as 
displaying all coursework to be done, or coursework that is due today and tomorrow.

In this program, there will be 9 total classes, including the main program class. The abstract class, Work, will act as a parent class for 
five other child classes in order to construct the object that will be used to hold information regarding the student’s work. The Subject 
class will contain a list of all that classes work along with behaviors to add and clear work from the class’s list of work. The final 
project will be the “Schedule” class which will contain a list of all the subjects along with behaviors to gather and modify information 
about the classes and their workloads. This schedule class, along with its behaviors, will then be used in the main program to be used by 
the user in modifying their schedule information from the main menu. 


                                                            NOTE TO USER:
                                                            
In this program, you must follow instructions when prompted otherwise code may result in a crash. For example, if when prompted to type
in the month number (December - 12) it will ask for (Integer), and you must put integer. The program will not immediatly crash but it
will once you try to use that date in other areas such as "Display Urgent Work" because it parses your input as an integer.
